Content for the GitHub page goes here.

Tincho was here because he's a nice guy.

Have got a few changes here that would be good to review:

1. These are the changes I want to push to the remote repo
2. Using Gitbash to submit a pull request
3. If you can pull my changes and merge, that would be great.
