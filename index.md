Content for the GitHub page goes here.

Tincho was here because he's a nice guy.

Have got a few changes here that would be good to review:

1. These are the changes I want to push to the remote repo
2. Used git add for the index.md file, followed by git commit.
3. Using Gitbash to submit a pull request (git request-pull)
4. If you can pull my changes and merge, that would be great.
5. Nevermind, think I need to make the pull request from Github rather than using command line.
